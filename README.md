<h4 align="center">A minimal static site generator (SSG) built with C++ </h4>


## Overview 
Palpatine is a minimal static site generator (SSG) built with C++. It is a command line tool that takes a directory of raw data (currently only txt) and generates a static website. It is designed to be fast, simple and easy to use.

### Requirements 
#### UNIX
First install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't have it already. 
If you don't have Xcode installed, you can at least run the `xcode-select --install` command to install the command line tools. This will ensure you have (clang++, gcc, git etc.) installed.\
Test if you have the required tools with;
- `clang++ --version` , if not install by running `brew install clang++`
- `cmake --version` (tested with 3.15.4) - if not install with `brew install cmake`
- `make --version` - if not install with `brew install make`



### How To Use
To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com), C++ compiler with `std=c++17` supported and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build the project. Normally you would have to specify particular cmake commands to build the project but I have automated that process in the `Makefile` so all you have to do is run `make prepare` in the root directory of the project. This will build the project and create an executable file in the `build/app` directory. You can examine the the Makefile to see what it does.

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/batunpc/palpatine

# Go into the repository
$ cd palpatine

# Build project w/ cmake and install dependencies 
$ make prepare

# Run the script
$ ./palpatine -i <input> -o <output> -s <stylesheet>
```
>**Note:** If you get permission denied error, you can run `chmod +x palpatine` to make the script executable.
### Flags
| Flag | Description | Required / Optional |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-i` | Specify raw data directory or file e.g. use `data` directory in the codebase | Required |
| `-o` | Specify particular directory that you want to generate static sites to. | Optional |
| `-s` | If you please, you can add custom stylesheets by specifying the css files.<br> By default it uses [bahunya](https://hakanalpay.com/bahunya/)| Optional|
| `-h` | This will display all the available options | Optional |


### Dependencies
CMake is used to confgure the following dependencies and they will be install in the `external` directory:
- [p-ranav/argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse) - A single-file header-only C++11 library for parsing command line arguments.
- [ikalnytskyi/termcolor](https://github.com/ikalnytskyi/termcolor) - A header-only C++ library for printing colored messages to a terminal.

## Features
 
- [x]  Generate a static site from a directory of text files
- [x]  Generate a stylesheet file for the static site
- [x]  Option to change the output directory
- [x]  Option to include a custom stylesheet link
- [x]  Generate a list of all pages in a directory, with links to each page
- [x]  Parse page title from the first line of the file if given
