<h4 align="center">A minimal static site generator (SSG) built with C++ </h4>


## Overview 
Palpatine is a minimal static site generator (SSG) built with C++. It is a command line tool that takes a directory of raw data (currently only txt) and generates a static website. It is designed to be fast, simple and easy to use.

### Requirements 
#### macOS
First install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't have it already. 
If you don't have Xcode installed, you can at least run the `xcode-select --install` command to install the command line tools. This will ensure you have (clang++, gcc, git etc.) installed.\
Test if you have the required tools with;
- `clang++ --version` , if not install by running `brew install clang++`
- `cmake --version` (tested with 3.15.4) - if not install with `brew install cmake`
- `make --version` - if not install with `brew install make`



### How To Use
To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com), C++ compiler with `std=c++17` supported and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build the project. Normally you would have to specify particular cmake commands to build the project but I have automated that process in the `Makefile` so all you have to do is run `make prepare` in the root directory of the project. This will build the project and create an executable file in the `build/app` directory. You can examine the the Makefile to see what it does.

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/batunpc/palpatine

# Go into the repository
$ cd palpatine

# Build project w/ cmake and install dependencies 
$ make prepare

# Run the script
$ ./palpatine -i <input> -o <output> -s <stylesheet>
```
>**Note:** If you get permission denied error, you can run `chmod +x palpatine` to make the script executable.
### Flags
| Flag | Description | Required / Optional |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-i` | Specify raw data directory or file e.g. use `data` directory in the codebase | Required |
| `-o` | Specify particular directory that you want to generate static sites to. | Optional |
| `-s` | If you please, you can add custom stylesheets by specifying the css files.<br> By default it uses [bahunya](https://hakanalpay.com/bahunya/)| Optional|
| `-h` | This will display all the available options | Optional |


### Dependencies
CMake is used to confgure the following dependencies and they will be install in the `external` directory:
- [p-ranav/argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse) - A single-file header-only C++11 library for parsing command line arguments.
- [ikalnytskyi/termcolor](https://github.com/ikalnytskyi/termcolor) - A header-only C++ library for printing colored messages to a terminal.

## Features
 
- [x]  Generate a static site from a directory of text files
- [x]  Generate a stylesheet file for the static site
- [x]  Option to change the output directory
- [x]  Option to include a custom stylesheet link
- [x]  Generate a list of all pages in a directory, with links to each page
- [x]  Parse page title from the first line of the file if given

### Configured with CMake

The config folder in the repository is responsible to contain `config.hpp.in` file. The files ending with `.in` means that CMake will make particular changes to the file before it is used. In this case, the `config.hpp.in` file will be used to generate `config.hpp` file in the build directory. The `config.hpp` file will be used to configure the project in the manner of version control and setting. The `config.hpp.in` file is configured with the following variables:

```cpp
static constexpr std::string_view project_name = "@PROJECT_NAME@";
static constexpr std::string_view project_author = "@PROJECT_AUTHOR@";
static constexpr std::string_view project_version = "@PROJECT_VERSION@";
static constexpr std::string_view project_description = "@PROJECT_DESCRIPTION@";
```

These variables will be replaced with the actual values in the root `CMakeLists.txt` file.

### Add Git Submodules with CMake

Primarily if we are using external libraries in any project, we can add them as git submodules. This is done by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
git submodule add <git-repo-url> <path-to-submodule>
```


There are many ways to use external libraries in CMake. One of the ways is to use git submodules. I have used git submodules to add the dependencies. According to my observations on other large C++ projects, they always have cmake folder in their root directory. This folder usually contains an function that handles the git submodules.

```cmake
#AddGitSubmodule.cmake
function(add_git_submodule dir)
  find_package(Git REQUIRED) # Ensure git is installed

  if(NOT EXISTS ${dir}/CMakeLists.txt)
    message(STATUS "ðŸš¨ Adding git submodule => ${dir}")
    execute_process(COMMAND ${GIT_EXECUTABLE}
      submodule update --init --recursive -- ${dir}
      WORKING_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}) # Absolute path to project root
  endif()

  add_subdirectory(${dir})
endfunction(add_git_submodule)
```

That said, we can use this function to add git submodules in our project. In the root `CMakeLists.txt` file, we can add the following lines:

```cmake
add_git_submodule(path/to/submodule)
```
